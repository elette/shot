SQL0952N  Processing was cancelled due to an interrupt.

Explanation: 

The user may have pressed the interrupt key sequence.

The statement processing is terminated. Some changes may have been
applied to the database, but not committed, before termination occurred.

You might also receive this error if Call Level Interface (CLI) issues
an interrupt because a query timed out. For example: if an application
uses the SQLSetStmtAttr() function to configure the
SQL_ATTR_QUERY_TIMEOUT statement attribute to a non-zero value, then if
a SQL statement or XQuery expression does not complete in the specified
amount of time, CLI will issue an interrupt to cancel the execution and
return to the application.

Federated system users: this situation can also be detected by the data
source.

User response: 

Continue the application.

If installing the sample database, drop it and install the sample
database again.

If you want to prevent CLI from issuing an interrupt when a query times
out, you can disable query timeout behavior by setting
QUERYTIMEOUTINTERVAL=0 in the db2cli.ini file. Disabling query timeout
behavior will allow queries run to completion, unless there is a
deadlock or lock wait timeout value set at the server.
